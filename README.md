EstimoteBinding
===============

Note - this is no longer going to be supported, Xamarin have released their own component for iOS, so this isn't really that useful any more except for reference.



Xamarin bindings for the Estimote iOS SDK.  This is a first cut and only discovering and ranging beacons has been tested.
More tests and a full test app to come later.

This uses the Unified API.
