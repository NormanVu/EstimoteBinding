EstimoteBinding
===============

This contains some old example code to show a created binding for the Estimote iOS SDK.  This goes with the blog post at http://www.jimbobbennett.io/binding-ios-libraries-in-xamarin/.

This code base is now an example cross platform app using the Xamarin iOS Estimote component.
